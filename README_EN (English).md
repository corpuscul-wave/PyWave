# PyWave v1.0: Linear Complexity Framework

PyWave is a high-performance library for neuromorphic computing. 
While standard AI stacks are trapped in $O(N^2)$ complexity, PyWave leverages iterative phase interference to achieve true $O(N)$ linear scaling.

### Core Features:
- **Phase Interference Core**: Replaces matrix multiplication with physical field dynamics.
- **Dynamic ADS**: Adaptive memory decay and reinforcement system (Use-it-or-lose-it).
- **AVX-512/AMX Optimization**: Direct CPU vectorization for maximum efficiency.

**The Issue:** Exponential computational growth in LLMs.
**The Solution:** Linear scalability via stochastic resonance.
